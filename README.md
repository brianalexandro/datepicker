# ui-datepicker
A minimal datepicker without any external dependencies.

## Features
* Preserve model value to be consistent ( which is : **yyyy-mm-dd** ) with database, so there's no need for further format manipulation on back end when you want to store the value to database.
* Support for multiple date format
